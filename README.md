## 📌 Project Purpose
Many individuals struggle with credit card debt due to overspending. According to a 2023 study by the Federal Reserve, **over 60% of Americans** carry credit card debt, often because they spend beyond their actual available balance. **FinPay** is designed to address this issue by keeping users accountable and promoting better financial decisions.

**How it works:**
- Tracks credit card transactions in real-time
- Notifies users after every purchase with their remaining monthly budget
- Includes an AI assistant for personalized financial insights

By ensuring users always know how much they have left in their budget, **FinPay** helps prevent overspending and encourages responsible credit usage.

## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions
### 🔴 Challenge 1: Integrating Plaid
**Problem:** Plaid required a dedicated Node backend for data retrieval and Express as middle-ware between the front-end and back-end.
**Solution:** We opted to use sandbox data provided by Plaid as a proof of concept, which provides direct transaction retrieval. We ended up giving up on Express for time reasons.

### 🔴 Challenge 2: OpenAI API Token
**Problem:** It was taking much longer than we're proud to admit to get a response from the API. We kept getting 404 Responses from our queries.
**Solution:** Turns out we didn't have the tier plan for ChatGPT 4o. So we used ChatGPT 4o-mini instead.
